This allows us to extend the semantics to continuous probability distributions, thereby settling an open problem posed by B'ar'any et al. We show that our semantics is fairly robust, allowing both parallel execution and arbitrary chase orders when evaluating a program.

22:T5a6,The safety alignment of current Large Language Models (LLMs) is vulnerable. Relatively simple attacks, or even benign fine-tuning, can jailbreak aligned models. We argue that many of these vulnerabilities are related to a shared underlying issue: safety alignment can take shortcuts, wherein the alignment adapts a model's generative distribution primarily over only its very first few output tokens. We refer to this issue as shallow safety alignment. In this paper, we present case studies to explain why shallow safety alignment can exist and provide evidence that current aligned LLMs are subject to this issue. We also show how these findings help explain multiple recently discovered vulnerabilities in LLMs, including the susceptibility to adversarial suffix attacks, prefilling attacks, decoding parameter attacks, and fine-tuning attacks. Importantly, we discuss how this consolidated notion of shallow safety alignment sheds light on promising research directions for mitigating these vulnerabilities. For instance, we show that deepening the safety alignment beyond just the first few tokens can often meaningfully improve robustness against some common exploits. Finally, we design a regularized finetuning objective that makes the safety alignment more persistent against fine-tuning attacks by constraining updates on initial tokens. Overall, we advocate that future safety alignment should be made more than just a few tokens deep.1d:["$","div","8",{"className":"ArticlePreview_ArticlePreview__59E_4","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"ArticlePreview_title__Snpua","children":["$","$Lf",null,{"href":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.05946","target":"_blank","children":"Safety Alignment Should Be Made More Than Just a Few Tokens Deep"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"ArticlePreview_tags__y8wnE","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"Tag_Tag__j3omn","children":"Cryptography and Security"}],["$","div","1",{"className":"Tag_Tag__j3omn","children":"Artificial Intelligence"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"ArticlePreview_publishedTime__MauIG","children":["published: ","2024-06-09"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"ArticlePreview_summary__Zyb4E","children":[["$","p","p-0",{"children":"$22"}]]}]]}]

23:T4ed,In large language model (LLM) pretraining, data quality is believed to determine model quality. In this paper, we re-examine the notion of "quality" from the perspective of pre- and post-training co-design. Specifically, we explore the possibility that pre-training on more toxic data can lead to better control in post-training, ultimately decreasing a model's output toxicity. First, we use a toy experiment to study how data composition affects the geometry of features in the representation space. Next, through controlled experiments with Olmo-1B models trained on varying ratios of clean and toxic data, we find that the concept of toxicity enjoys a less entangled linear representation as the proportion of toxic data increases. Furthermore, we show that although toxic data increases the generational toxicity of the base model, it also makes the toxicity easier to remove. Evaluations on Toxigen and Real Toxicity Prompts demonstrate that models trained on toxic data achieve a better trade-off between reducing generational toxicity and preserving general capabilities when detoxifying techniques such as inference-time intervention (ITI) are applied. Our findings suggest that, with post-training taken into account, bad data may lead to good models.1f:["$","div","9",{"className":"ArticlePreview_ArticlePreview__59E_4","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"ArticlePreview_title__Snpua","children":["$","$Lf",null,{"href":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.04741","target":"_blank","children":"When Bad Data Leads to Good Models"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"ArticlePreview_tags__y8wnE","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"Tag_Tag__j3omn","children":"Machine Learning"}],["$","div","1",{"className":"Tag_Tag__j3omn","children":"Artificial Intelligence"}],["$","div","2",{"className":"Tag_Tag__j3omn","children":"Computation and Language"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"ArticlePreview_publishedTime__MauIG","children":["published: ","2025-05-07"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"ArticlePreview_summary__Zyb4E","children":[["$","p","p-0",{"children":"$23"}]]}]]}]
