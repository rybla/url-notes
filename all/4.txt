1b:T5a6,The safety alignment of current Large Language Models (LLMs) is vulnerable. Relatively simple attacks, or even benign fine-tuning, can jailbreak aligned models. We argue that many of these vulnerabilities are related to a shared underlying issue: safety alignment can take shortcuts, wherein the alignment adapts a model's generative distribution primarily over only its very first few output tokens. We refer to this issue as shallow safety alignment. In this paper, we present case studies to explain why shallow safety alignment can exist and provide evidence that current aligned LLMs are subject to this issue. We also show how these findings help explain multiple recently discovered vulnerabilities in LLMs, including the susceptibility to adversarial suffix attacks, prefilling attacks, decoding parameter attacks, and fine-tuning attacks. Importantly, we discuss how this consolidated notion of shallow safety alignment sheds light on promising research directions for mitigating these vulnerabilities. For instance, we show that deepening the safety alignment beyond just the first few tokens can often meaningfully improve robustness against some common exploits. Finally, we design a regularized finetuning objective that makes the safety alignment more persistent against fine-tuning attacks by constraining updates on initial tokens. Overall, we advocate that future safety alignment should be made more than just a few tokens deep.13:["$","div","4",{"className":"ArticlePreview_ArticlePreview__59E_4","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"ArticlePreview_title__Snpua","children":["$","$Lf",null,{"href":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.05946","target":"_blank","children":"Safety Alignment Should Be Made More Than Just a Few Tokens Deep"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"ArticlePreview_tags__y8wnE","children":[["$","$Lf","0",{"className":"ArticlePreview_tag___oIyn","href":"/tag/Cryptography%20and%20Security","children":"Cryptography and Security"}],["$","$Lf","1",{"className":"ArticlePreview_tag___oIyn","href":"/tag/Artificial%20Intelligence","children":"Artificial Intelligence"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"ArticlePreview_summary__Zyb4E","children":[["$","p","p-0",{"children":"$1b"}]]}]]}]
1c:T4ed,In large language model (LLM) pretraining, data quality is believed to determine model quality. In this paper, we re-examine the notion of "quality" from the perspective of pre- and post-training co-design. Specifically, we explore the possibility that pre-training on more toxic data can lead to better control in post-training, ultimately decreasing a model's output toxicity. First, we use a toy experiment to study how data composition affects the geometry of features in the representation space. Next, through controlled experiments with Olmo-1B models trained on varying ratios of clean and toxic data, we find that the concept of toxicity enjoys a less entangled linear representation as the proportion of toxic data increases. Furthermore, we show that although toxic data increases the generational toxicity of the base model, it also makes the toxicity easier to remove. Evaluations on Toxigen and Real Toxicity Prompts demonstrate that models trained on toxic data achieve a better trade-off between reducing generational toxicity and preserving general capabilities when detoxifying techniques such as inference-time intervention (ITI) are applied. Our findings suggest that, with post-training taken into account, bad data may lead to good models.14:["$","div","5",{"className":"ArticlePreview_ArticlePreview__59E_4","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"ArticlePreview_title__Snpua","children":["$","$Lf",null,{"href":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.04741","target":"_blank","children":"When Bad Data Leads to Good Models"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"ArticlePreview_tags__y8wnE","children":[["$","$Lf","0",{"className":"ArticlePreview_tag___oIyn","href":"/tag/Machine%20Learning","children":"Machine Learning"}],["$","$Lf","1",{"className":"ArticlePreview_tag___oIyn","href":"/tag/Artificial%20Intelligence","children":"Artificial Intelligence"}],["$","$Lf","2",{"className":"ArticlePreview_tag___oIyn","href":"/tag/Computation%20and%20Language","children":"Computation and Language"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"ArticlePreview_summary__Zyb4E","children":[["$","p","p-0",{"children":"$1c"}]]}]]}]

1d:T41c,We introduce the Byte Latent Transformer (BLT), a new byte-level LLM architecture that, for the first time, matches tokenization-based LLM performance at scale with significant improvements in inference efficiency and robustness. BLT encodes bytes into dynamically sized patches, which serve as the primary units of computation. Patches are segmented based on the entropy of the next byte, allocating more compute and model capacity where increased data complexity demands it. We present the first FLOP controlled scaling study of byte-level models up to 8B parameters and 4T training bytes. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of scaling models trained on raw bytes without a fixed vocabulary. Both training and inference efficiency improve due to dynamically selecting long patches when data is predictable, along with qualitative improvements on reasoning and long tail generalization. Overall, for fixed inference costs, BLT shows significantly better scaling than tokenization-based models, by simultaneously growing both patch and model size.17:["$","div","8",{"className":"ArticlePreview_ArticlePreview__59E_4","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"ArticlePreview_title__Snpua","children":["$","$Lf",null,{"href":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09871","target":"_blank","children":"Byte Latent Transformer: Patches Scale Better Than Tokens"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"ArticlePreview_tags__y8wnE","children":[["$","$Lf","0",{"className":"ArticlePreview_tag___oIyn","href":"/tag/Computation%20and%20Language","children":"Computation and Language"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"ArticlePreview_summary__Zyb4E","children":[["$","p","p-0",{"children":"$1d"}]]}]]}]
1e:T67a,Training large language models (LLMs) on source code significantly enhances their general-purpose reasoning abilities, but the mechanisms underlying this generalisation are poorly understood. In this paper, we propose Programming by Backprop (PBB) as a potential driver of this effect - teaching a model to evaluate a program for inputs by training on its source code alone, without ever seeing I/O examples. To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of programs representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source code and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We find evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for inputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations. Firstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code rather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can produce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the program within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the program in-context via chain-of-thought. We further show that PBB leads to more robust evaluation of programs across inputs than training on I/O pairs drawn from a distribution that mirrors naturally occurring data. Our findings suggest a mechanism for enhanced reasoning through code training: it allows LLMs to internalise reusable algorithmic abstractions. Significant scope remains for future work to enable LLMs to more effectively learn from symbolic procedures, and progress in this direction opens other avenues like model alignment by training on formal constitutional principles.18:["$","div","9",{"className":"ArticlePreview_ArticlePreview__59E_4","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"ArticlePreview_title__Snpua","children":["$","$Lf",null,{"href":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.18777","target":"_blank","children":"Programming by Backprop: LLMs Acquire Reusable Algorithmic Abstractions During Code Training"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"ArticlePreview_tags__y8wnE","children":[["$","$Lf","0",{"className":"ArticlePreview_tag___oIyn","href":"/tag/Artificial%20Intelligence","children":"Artificial Intelligence"}],["$","$Lf","1",{"className":"ArticlePreview_tag___oIyn","href":"/tag/Computation%20and%20Language","children":"Computation and Language"}],["$","$Lf","2",{"className":"ArticlePreview_tag___oIyn","href":"/tag/Machine%20Learning","children":"Machine Learning"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"ArticlePreview_summary__Zyb4E","children":[["$","p","p-0",{"children":"$1e"}]]}]]}]
