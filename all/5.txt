10:T735,Despite their impressive capabilities, aligned large language models (LLMs) often generate outputs that lack diversity. What drives this stability in the generation? We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of probability concentration in the model's output distribution. To quantify this concentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant measure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our empirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as generation progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they generate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output distribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude (e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps explain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies. Building on this insight, we find this stability has surprising implications for complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g., DeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating longer reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic (lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs. We hypothesize that alignment tuning does not fundamentally change a model's behavior, but instead steers it toward stylistic tokens (e.g., "Sure") that unlock low-entropy trajectories already present in the base model. This view is supported by nudging experiments, which show that prompting base models with such tokens can similarly reduce BF. Together, our findings establish BF as a powerful diagnostic for understanding and controlling LLM outputs - clarifying how alignment reduces variability, how CoT promotes stable generations, and how base models can be steered away from diversity.4:["$","div",null,{"className":"page_Page__nS49m","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"Header_Header__VDN4T","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"Header_item__PWJos","children":["$","$Lf",null,{"href":"/","children":"url-notes"}]}],[[["$","div","separator-0",{"className":"Header_separator__zF22U","children":"|"}],["$","div","item-0",{"className":"Header_item__PWJos","children":["$","$Lf","0",{"href":"/all/0","children":"all"}]}]],[["$","div","separator-1",{"className":"Header_separator__zF22U","children":"|"}],["$","div","item-1",{"className":"Header_item__PWJos","children":["$","span","1",{"children":["page ",6," of ",20]}]}]]]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"page_content___i7Ut","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"page_previews__BuBMS","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"ArticlePreview_ArticlePreview__59E_4","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"ArticlePreview_title__Snpua","children":["$","$Lf",null,{"href":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17871","target":"_blank","children":"How Alignment Shrinks the Generative Horizon"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"ArticlePreview_tags__y8wnE","children":[["$","$Lf","0",{"className":"ArticlePreview_tag___oIyn","href":"/tag/","children":""}],["$","$Lf","1",{"className":"ArticlePreview_tag___oIyn","href":"/tag/Computation%20and%20Language","children":"Computation and Language"}],["$","$Lf","2",{"className":"ArticlePreview_tag___oIyn","href":"/tag/Artificial%20Intelligence","children":"Artificial Intelligence"}],["$","$Lf","3",{"className":"ArticlePreview_tag___oIyn","href":"/tag/Machine%20Learning","children":"Machine Learning"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"ArticlePreview_summary__Zyb4E","children":[["$","p","p-0",{"children":"$10"}]]}]]}],["$","div","1",{"className":"ArticlePreview_ArticlePreview__59E_4","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"ArticlePreview_title__Snpua","children":["$","$Lf",null,{"href":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21521","target":"_blank","children":"Potemkin Understanding in Large Language Models"}]}],"$L11","$L12"]}],"$L13","$L14","$L15","$L16","$L17","$L18","$L19","$L1a"]}]}],"$L1b"]}]

1d:T475,Large language models (LLMs) are regularly evaluated using benchmark datasets. But what justifies making inferences about an LLM's capabilities based on its answers to a curated set of questions? This paper first introduces a formal framework to address this question. The key is to note that the benchmarks used to test LLMs -- such as AP exams -- are also those used to test people. However, this raises an implication: these benchmarks are only valid tests if LLMs misunderstand concepts in ways that mirror human misunderstandings. Otherwise, success on benchmarks only demonstrates potemkin understanding: the illusion of understanding driven by answers irreconcilable with how any human would interpret a concept. We present two procedures for quantifying the existence of potemkins: one using a specially designed benchmark in three domains, the other using a general procedure that provides a lower-bound on their prevalence. We find that potemkins are ubiquitous across models, tasks, and domains. We also find that these failures reflect not just incorrect understanding, but deeper internal incoherence in concept representations.12:["$","div",null,{"className":"ArticlePreview_summary__Zyb4E","children":[["$","p","p-0",{"children":"$1d"}]]}]

22:T5a6,Humans organize knowledge into compact categories through semantic compression by mapping diverse instances to abstract representations while preserving meaning (e.g., robin and blue jay are both birds; most birds can fly). These concepts reflect a trade-off between expressive fidelity and representational simplicity. Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable linguistic abilities, yet whether their internal representations strike a human-like trade-off between compression and semantic fidelity is unclear. We introduce a novel information-theoretic framework, drawing from Rate-Distortion Theory and the Information Bottleneck principle, to quantitatively compare these strategies. Analyzing token embeddings from a diverse suite of LLMs against seminal human categorization benchmarks, we uncover key divergences. While LLMs form broad conceptual categories that align with human judgment, they struggle to capture the fine-grained semantic distinctions crucial for human understanding. More fundamentally, LLMs demonstrate a strong bias towards aggressive statistical compression, whereas human conceptual systems appear to prioritize adaptive nuance and contextual richness, even if this results in lower compressional efficiency by our measures. These findings illuminate critical differences between current AI and human cognitive architectures, guiding pathways toward LLMs with more human-aligned conceptual representations.14:["$","div","3",{"className":"ArticlePreview_ArticlePreview__59E_4","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"ArticlePreview_title__Snpua","children":["$","$Lf",null,{"href":"https://yosefk.com/blog/llms-arent-world-models.htmlhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17117","target":"_blank","children":"From Tokens to Thoughts: How LLMs and Humans Trade Compression for Meaning"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"ArticlePreview_tags__y8wnE","children":[["$","$Lf","0",{"className":"ArticlePreview_tag___oIyn","href":"/tag/Computation%20and%20Language","children":"Computation and Language"}],["$","$Lf","1",{"className":"ArticlePreview_tag___oIyn","href":"/tag/Artificial%20Intelligence","children":"Artificial Intelligence"}],["$","$Lf","2",{"className":"ArticlePreview_tag___oIyn","href":"/tag/Information%20Theory","children":"Information Theory"}],["$","$Lf","3",{"className":"ArticlePreview_tag___oIyn","href":"/tag/Information%20Theory","children":"Information Theory"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"ArticlePreview_summary__Zyb4E","children":[["$","p","p-0",{"children":"$22"}]]}]]}]

23:T411,With Gaussian Elimination as a representative family of numerical and symbolic algorithms, we use multi-stage programming, monads and Ocaml's advanced module system to demonstrate the complete elimination of the abstraction overhead while avoiding any inspection of the generated code. We parameterize our Gaussian Elimination code to a great extent (over domain, matrix representations, determinant tracking, pivoting policies, result types, etc) at no run-time cost. Because the resulting code is generated just right and not changed afterwards, we enjoy MetaOCaml's guaranty that the generated code is well-typed. We further demonstrate that various abstraction parameters (aspects) can be made orthogonal and compositional, even in the presence of name-generation for temporaries and other bindings and “interleaving” of aspects. We also show how to encode some domain-specific knowledge so that “clearly wrong” compositions can be statically rejected by the compiler when processing the generator rather than the generated code.19:["$","div","8",{"className":"ArticlePreview_ArticlePreview__59E_4","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"ArticlePreview_title__Snpua","children":["$","$Lf",null,{"href":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/11561347_18","target":"_blank","children":"Multi-stage programming with functors and monads | Proceedings of the 4th international conference on Generative Programming and Component Engineering"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"ArticlePreview_tags__y8wnE","children":[["$","$Lf","0",{"className":"ArticlePreview_tag___oIyn","href":"/tag/multi-stage%20programming","children":"multi-stage programming"}],["$","$Lf","1",{"className":"ArticlePreview_tag___oIyn","href":"/tag/functional%20programming","children":"functional programming"}],["$","$Lf","2",{"className":"ArticlePreview_tag___oIyn","href":"/tag/ocaml","children":"ocaml"}],["$","$Lf","3",{"className":"ArticlePreview_tag___oIyn","href":"/tag/metaocaml","children":"metaocaml"}],["$","$Lf","4",{"className":"ArticlePreview_tag___oIyn","href":"/tag/monads","children":"monads"}],["$","$Lf","5",{"className":"ArticlePreview_tag___oIyn","href":"/tag/functors","children":"functors"}],["$","$Lf","6",{"className":"ArticlePreview_tag___oIyn","href":"/tag/generative%20programming","children":"generative programming"}],["$","$Lf","7",{"className":"ArticlePreview_tag___oIyn","href":"/tag/metaprogramming","children":"metaprogramming"}],["$","$Lf","8",{"className":"ArticlePreview_tag___oIyn","href":"/tag/compilers","children":"compilers"}],["$","$Lf","9",{"className":"ArticlePreview_tag___oIyn","href":"/tag/type%20systems","children":"type systems"}],["$","$Lf","10",{"className":"ArticlePreview_tag___oIyn","href":"/tag/gaussian%20elimination","children":"gaussian elimination"}],["$","$Lf","11",{"className":"ArticlePreview_tag___oIyn","href":"/tag/numerical%20algorithms","children":"numerical algorithms"}],["$","$Lf","12",{"className":"ArticlePreview_tag___oIyn","href":"/tag/symbolic%20algorithms","children":"symbolic algorithms"}],["$","$Lf","13",{"className":"ArticlePreview_tag___oIyn","href":"/tag/performance%20optimization","children":"performance optimization"}],["$","$Lf","14",{"className":"ArticlePreview_tag___oIyn","href":"/tag/abstraction%20overhead","children":"abstraction overhead"}],["$","$Lf","15",{"className":"ArticlePreview_tag___oIyn","href":"/tag/code%20generation","children":"code generation"}],["$","$Lf","16",{"className":"ArticlePreview_tag___oIyn","href":"/tag/aspect-oriented%20programming","children":"aspect-oriented programming"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"ArticlePreview_summary__Zyb4E","children":[["$","p","p-0",{"children":"$23"}]]}]]}]
