22:T49c,AI companies are increasingly using AI systems to accelerate AI research and development. Today‚Äôs AI systems help researchers write code, analyze research papers, and generate training data. Future systems could be significantly more capable ‚Äì potentially automating the entire AI development cycle from formulating research questions and designing experiments to implementing, testing, and refining new AI systems. We argue that such systems could trigger a runaway feedback loop in which they quickly develop more advanced AI, which itself speeds up the development of even more advanced AI, resulting in extremely fast AI progress, even without the need for additional computer chips. Empirical evidence on the rate at which AI research efforts improve AI algorithms suggests that this positive feedback loop could overcome diminishing returns to continued AI research efforts. We evaluate two additional bottlenecks to rapid progress: training AI systems from scratch takes months, and  improving AI algorithms often requires computationally expensive experiments. However, we find that there are possible workarounds that could enable a runaway feedback loop nonetheless.15:["$","div","4",{"className":"ArticlePreview_ArticlePreview__59E_4","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"ArticlePreview_title__Snpua","children":["$","$Lf",null,{"href":"https://www.forethought.org/research/will-ai-r-and-d-automation-cause-a-software-intelligence-explosion#article","target":"_blank","children":"Will AI R&D Automation Cause a Software Intelligence Explosion?"}]}],"$undefined","$undefined",["$","div",null,{"className":"ArticlePreview_summary__Zyb4E","children":[["$","p","p-0",{"children":"$22"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"ArticlePreview_footer__lkeLY","children":["$","$Lf",null,{"className":"LinkButton_LinkButton__nW1G0","href":"https://www.forethought.org/research/will-ai-r-and-d-automation-cause-a-software-intelligence-explosion#article","target":"_blank","children":"üîó"}]}]]}]

23:T663,The goal of traffic simulation is to augment a potentially limited amount of manually-driven miles that is available for testing and validation, with a much larger amount of simulated synthetic miles. The culmination of this vision would be a generative simulated city, where given a map of the city and an autonomous vehicle (AV) software stack, the simulator can seamlessly simulate the trip from point A to point B by populating the city around the AV and controlling all aspects of the scene, from animating the dynamic agents (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians) to controlling the traffic light states. We refer to this vision as CitySim, which requires an agglomeration of simulation technologies: scene generation to populate the initial scene, agent behavior modeling to animate the scene, occlusion reasoning, dynamic scene generation to seamlessly spawn and remove agents, and environment simulation for factors such as traffic lights. While some key technologies have been separately studied in various works, others such as dynamic scene generation and environment simulation have received less attention in the research community. We propose SceneDiffuser++, the first end-to-end generative world model trained on a single loss function capable of point A-to-B simulation on a city scale integrating all the requirements above. We demonstrate the city-scale traffic simulation capability of SceneDiffuser++ and study its superior realism under long simulation conditions. We evaluate the simulation quality on an augmented version of the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) with larger map regions to support trip-level simulation.19:["$","div","6",{"className":"ArticlePreview_ArticlePreview__59E_4","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"ArticlePreview_title__Snpua","children":["$","$Lf",null,{"href":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21976v1","target":"_blank","children":"SceneDiffuser++: City-Scale Traffic Simulation via a Generative World Model"}]}],"$undefined",["$","div",null,{"className":"ArticlePreview_publishedTime__MauIG","children":["published: ","2025-06-27"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"ArticlePreview_summary__Zyb4E","children":[["$","p","p-0",{"children":"$23"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"ArticlePreview_footer__lkeLY","children":["$","$Lf",null,{"className":"LinkButton_LinkButton__nW1G0","href":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21976v1","target":"_blank","children":"üîó"}]}]]}]
